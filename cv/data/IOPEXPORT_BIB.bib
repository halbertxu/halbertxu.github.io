	abstract = {Structural damage is an important criterion that can affect the system performance and degrade its ability from its original condition. When it comes to an aircraft, it is the wings of the aircraft that is prone to more damages compared to the body since the wings provide overall structure stability to the aircraft. It is thus mandatory to monitor the surface of the aircraft wing periodically in search of new damages or changes occurring in the wing structures. The term Health Monitoring systems is introduced in these precepts, that are useful in identifying damages in aircrafts, space crafts and mechanical infrastructures by taking periodic measurements with the help of various transmitters and sensors. Waves are allowed to propagate through the wing surface and the deviations occurring in the frequency of the waves are recorded and compared which helps in determining the various types of damages that occur. Yet another consideration is that the sensors embedded to the aircraft wing must be light weight, cost effective, user friendly at the same time provide accurate results for easy diagnosis of the problem. This is achieved by making use of lamb waves (also named as guided plate waves). The proposed work aims at the health monitoring of aerospace and mechanical structures, by using the wave propagation method and the use of piezo-electric wafer active sensors. Results have been validated by experimental and analytical calculations and the proposed method shows enhanced performance in the detection of cracks on the structural surfaces.}
